# We need access to CRUD operations for database interactions within tasks.
# This creates a potential circular dependency if crud.py imports tasks.py.
# A common pattern is to pass IDs to tasks, and tasks re-fetch data using CRUD.
# Alternatively, service layers can be used. For now, let's keep it simple
# and assume tasks can import CRUD or a dedicated DB access layer for tasks.

# To avoid circular import with app.crud directly, we might pass a callable or use IDs.
# For now, let's define the task structure. DB interaction details to be refined.
